# sheet
TypeScript toolkit featuring spreadsheet-like data structure &amp; related utilities for modern internet applications.

## Why?

- **Data Portability**: JSON is a lightweight and language-independent format. Using JSON to represent spreadsheet data allows easy sharing, exporting, or transforming data across different platforms.
- **Interoperability**: Applications or APIs that need to handle spreadsheet data programmatically can leverage this format to process data from various sources.
- **Automation**: Sheet JSON allows for easy automation and manipulation of complex data structures (such as large tradebooks or reports) by transforming or merging data without manual spreadsheet manipulation.
- **Standardized Structure**: This ensures that the data layout (headers, rows) and any metadata (sheet names, discriminators) are clearly defined and accessible in a programmatic manner.
